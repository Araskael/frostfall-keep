It must be written down, so that the variety that exists within our kin does not get snuffed out. There is, as the ancient saying goes
more than one way to skin a molerat.  As such there are many different kinds of Shaman, and while it doesn't matter overly much
that you define yourself within these proscribed options do remember that it does take all kinds.

The types, listed in the next few pages are...

- Healer
- Spirit-Mender
- Spiritualist
- War-Shaman

The Healer

Healers often come from the ranks of villagers who showed moderate affinity for the spirits along with their desire
to heal the wounds of others. They are often self taught, but can be very effective due to the guidance they gain
from their time with the spirits. Some heavily lean on the spirits for knowledge, so heavily lean on learning from outlanders.

Both paths are viable and accepted, but the wounded ultimately have the final say in what they will or won't accept.

The Spirit-Mender

Spirit-Menders, or Menders for short, are often much more in tune with the wounds that can not be fixed with thread &
needle.  They know that not all bruises leave a mark.  That the soul and the mind can take only so much of a beating
aside from the body itself.

They are focused largely on the wellbeing of others around them, and many have the spirits guide them to the answers
that will help bandage and soothe the burns of the mind.

The Spiritualist

Spiritualist Shamans often tend to combine aloofness with their fellows with a deep understanding of the natural order
of the spirits.  They hold their scrying orbs in hand and seek what it is they can learn from this world from the confines
of the soul, and not the body.  They tend to have relationships with the spirits that are far more strong than other Shamans.

They often know strange rituals that only the spirits have told them, act in strange manners, all while still caring for the tribe
in the way that their skillset allows most readily.

--PAGEBREAK--

The War-Shaman path is often chosen by warriors who, through some divine intervention outside of their control, were
forced into the path of becoming a shaman. The spirits are fickle and, by human definition, perhaps even deranged. War-Shamans
may know rites, they may know how to heal.  They know how to solve mortal problems in the way that our ancestors knew best usually.

All while the spirits whisper in their ears that what they do is proper.
