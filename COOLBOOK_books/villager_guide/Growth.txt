If you seek to grow.
Find it among those who ripen.
Seek your elders care.

To out-go and search.
To deepen ones knowledge base.
To toil the unknown.

To remember fear.
To remember what was lost.
To regrow what can.

--PAGEBREAK--

This is to say, if you as a villager wish to move upwards into another life path it is in your hands to do so, with or without those of that path about.

For hunters: Seek battle with monsters that adorn the wasteland.
For shamans: Seek the spirits, seek to fix what is with the care from those that came before.
for druids: Seek to understand the intracies of what grows

Your life is your own, and your choices yours to decide upon.  Understand that what you may want though may be different than what plays out in the song of existence.

Know Peace.
